# Toolbox

There are several tools in the Map Maker which are explained below. New features will be added soon.

## Map size

**Height:** Set the height of your map
**Width:** Set the hidth of your map

if you create a big map you will have to use the zoom out feature.

## Enemy Identification (so_long BONUS)

If you want to create a map with enemies you can set your so_long bonus enemy char / int.

## Rubber

Not sure which Block you want at this Position? No problem, just use the rubber to delete the actual block.
You dont have to use the rubber,  **you can just replace the actual block with another one.**

**IMPORTANT:** if you generate a map with white rubber places you will have some "6" in your number map. its only for visual purpose.

## Zoom out

To see the whole map, you can zoom in.
**Be careful:** zooming in can freeze the page at the moment.

## Pencils

**Wall:** Draw walls (NumberMap identifier: 1)
**Floor:** Draw the floor. Floor is the default filled block (NumberMap identifier: 0)
**Collectible:** Draw collectibles (NumberMap identifier: 1)
**Player/Start:** Draw start (NumberMap identifier: P)
**Enemy:** Draw enemy (NumberMap identifier: [your choice -> default F])
**Goal:** Draw exit (NumberMap identifier: E)
